# Express.js Unhandled Database Error

This repository demonstrates an example of a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file contains code with a missing error handling. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the correct solution.

## Bug Description
The Express.js route handler lacks proper error handling for database operations. This can lead to unexpected application behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

## Solution
Improved error handling is crucial for creating robust and reliable applications.  The solution file shows how to use try...catch blocks for better error handling and sending appropriate HTTP status codes in error responses.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `node bug.js`
3. Try to access a user ID that doesn't exist in the database.  Observe the unexpected behavior and/or error messages.

## How to fix the bug
1. Examine the `bugSolution.js` file.
2. Implement similar error handling in your own Express.js applications.

## Lessons Learned
Always include thorough error handling in your application code to prevent crashes and provide better user experiences.
